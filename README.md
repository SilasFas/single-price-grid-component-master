## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Media Query

### What I learned

A very interesting technique that I could use on this project was CSS variables, which is something that I need to work on a little further. 

### Continued development

Although I could apply Media Query CSS variable technique on this project, I still need to enhance these two techniques.

### Useful resources

- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped me with CSS variables. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
